This math.c file contains a function, math, which allows a user to input
the two integer values, num1 and num2, along with the symbol for the 
supported operation. The operations supported by this function are 
addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and 
modulo (%). The value of the outcome from the input operation is returned
as an integer. When performing division or modulo, the function checks 
for denominators of zero and will return an error if such a situation is 
found. If an operator outside of the five provided is used, a message 
is returned to the user specifying an unsupported operation.
